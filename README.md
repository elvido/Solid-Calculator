# Solid Calculator - a simple SolidJS project template
This project is a lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA) that implements a desktop calculator using SolidJS, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Rollup, and Yarn. It serves as a clean, modular template for new projects built on the same modern frontend stack.
