# Solid Calculator - a simple SolidJS project template

This project is a lightweight Single Page Application (SPA) that implements a desktop calculator using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It serves as a clean, modular template for new projects built on the same modern frontend stack.
